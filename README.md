#Steps how to make it run  
 
 
First, gotta check if you've got Node.js and npm installed. Open your terminal and type  
 
 node -v  
 npm -v 
 
 Hopefully, you see some numbers! 
 
Then, navigate into the project's folder in your terminal. Use the  
 
 cd  
 
command. For example: cd Desktop/recipe-site. 
 
Next, you need to grab all the project's 'ingredients' (dependencies).  
Run 
 
 npm install  
 
 in the terminal. This might take a little bit. 
 
Now, let's actually start the thing! Usually, you can do this by running npm start in the terminal. Keep an eye on the terminal output – it should tell you where the site is running like 
 http://localhost:3000

Finally, open your web browser and go to that address (e.g., http://localhost:3000). If all went well, you should see the recipe site!
